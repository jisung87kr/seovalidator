## 🚀 Key Features Implemented

### Advanced Scoring System
```php
// Example of advanced scoring with competitive factors
$result = $scoreCalculatorService->calculate($parsedData, [
    'industry' => 'e-commerce',
    'keyword_difficulty' => 'high',
    'search_volume' => 'very_high',
    'competitor_count' => 50,
    'content_age_months' => 3
]);

// Returns comprehensive scoring data:
// - overall_score with competitive adjustments
// - category_scores with advanced algorithms
// - performance_metrics (execution time, memory usage)
// - competitive_factors analysis
// - industry-specific weights applied
```

### Performance Optimizations
- **Execution Time Tracking**: Sub-millisecond precision performance monitoring
- **Memory Usage Monitoring**: Real-time memory consumption tracking
- **Intelligent Caching**:
  - Configurable TTL based on content type (15 min for news, 6 hours for static)
  - Data compression for large analysis results
  - Cache hit/miss ratio analytics
- **Competitive Factor Caching**: Reduced computation for repeated competitive analysis

### Industry-Specific Adaptations
- **E-commerce**: Higher weight for images (15%) and structured data (8%)
- **Blog**: Increased content importance (30%) and heading structure (20%)
- **Local Business**: Enhanced structured data (15%) and technical SEO (15%)
- **News**: Prioritized speed (15%) and social sharing (10%)

## 📊 Technical Specifications

### Score Calculation Algorithm v2.0.0
```
Advanced Overall Score = (Weighted Category Scores × Competitive Factor × Freshness Factor)
```

**Competitive Factors**:
- Keyword Difficulty: low (1.0) → very_high (2.0)
- Search Volume: low (0.9) → very_high (1.2)
- Combined Factor: (Difficulty + Volume) / 2

**Freshness Factors**:
- News: 5% decay per month
- Blog: 2% decay per month
- Evergreen: 0.5% decay per month
- Product: 1% decay per month

### Caching Strategy
```
Cache Key Structure: seo_analysis:{pattern}:{hash}:{context_hash}
TTL Configuration:
├── full_analysis: 1 hour
├── score_only: 30 minutes
├── technical_audit: 4 hours
├── performance_metrics: 15 minutes
└── competitive_data: 24 hours
```
