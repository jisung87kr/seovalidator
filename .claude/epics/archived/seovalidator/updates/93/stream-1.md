## Integration with Existing Services
The dashboard is designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing SEO analysis services:
- Uses `App\Jobs\AnalyzeUrl` for analysis processing

- Leverages existing scoring and calculation services
- Maintains consistency with API structure

## Performance Considerations
- Optimized asset building with Vite
- Lazy loading for chart components
- Efficient Livewire component structure
- Minimal JavaScript footprint
- TailwindCSS purging for production

## Ready for Production
The dashboard implementation includes:
- Production-ready asset compilation
- Proper error handling and validation
- Responsive design testing
- Component reusability
- Maintainable code structure

## Next Steps for Full Integration
1. Connect to actual database (SQLite driver installation)
2. Run migrations to create tables
3. Integration with real analysis queue jobs
4. Authentication system integration
5. API endpoint connections
6. WebSocket implementation for real-time updates
