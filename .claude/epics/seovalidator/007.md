# Task 007: Puppeteer Web Crawler Service

## Description
Build headless Chrome crawler using Puppeteer for accurate page rendering and data collection. This service will provide the core web scraping capabilities needed for SEO analysis with proper error handling and resource management.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Puppeteer service properly configured and initialized
- [ ] Screenshot capture functionality for both mobile and desktop viewports
- [ ] DOM analysis capabilities to extract page elements and content
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for network failures, timeouts, and page errors
- [ ] Resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks and zombie processes
- [ ] Configurable timeout and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Support for JavaScript-heavy single page applications
- [ ] Basic security measures (user-agent rotation, request throttling)

## Technical Requirements
- Install and configure Puppeteer with headless Chrome
- Implement proper page lifecycle management
- Add support for custom viewport sizes and device emulation
- Include network request interception for performance analysis
- Implement cookie and session management
- Add logging and monitoring for debugging
- Handle dynamic content loading with appropriate wait strategies

## Implementation Notes
- Use Puppeteer cluster for better resource management
- Implement queue-based crawling to handle concurrent requests
- Add metrics collection for performance monitoring
- Consider proxy support for IP rotation if needed
- Ensure proper cleanup of browser instances and pages

## Dependencies
- Task 001: Core Infrastructure Setup (Laravel app, database, queues)
- Task 003: Database Models and Migrations (for storing crawl results)

## Effort Estimation
**Size: L (Large)**
- Estimated Hours: 24-40 hours
- Complexity: High due to browser automation and resource management
- Risk: Medium - external dependency on Chrome/Chromium

## Definition of Done
- Puppeteer service can successfully crawl and analyze web pages
- All acceptance criteria are met and tested
- Code follows project standards and includes comprehensive tests
- Documentation is complete with usage examples
- Error handling covers all identified edge cases
- Performance benchmarks meet specified requirements
