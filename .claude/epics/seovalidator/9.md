# Task 9: Database Schema & Migration Setup

## Overview
Create comprehensive database migrations for all core entities including URLs, analysis results, users, and API keys with proper relationships and indexing.

## Description
Design and implement the complete database schema for the SEO validation platform. This includes creating migrations for core entities, establishing proper relationships between tables, adding necessary indexes for performance, and creating database seeders for development and testing environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User authentication tables (users, password_resets, personal_access_tokens)
- [ ] URL management tables (urls, url_analysis_requests)
- [ ] Analysis results tables (analysis_results, analysis_metrics)
- [ ] API management tables (api_keys, api_usage_logs)
- [ ] Queue and job tables (jobs, failed_jobs)
- [ ] All foreign key relationships defined and constrained
- [ ] Database indexes created for performance optimization
- [ ] Database seeders for development data
- [ ] Migration rollback functionality tested
- [ ] Database schema documentation generated

## Technical Requirements
- Create migrations for all core entities with proper field types
- Implement foreign key constraints and cascade rules
- Add database indexes for frequently queried fields
- Use JSON columns for flexible analysis result storage
- Implement soft deletes where appropriate
- Create factory classes for testing data generation
- Set up database seeders with realistic sample data
- Configure database connection pooling and optimization

## Dependencies
- Must be completed after Laravel application setup (7)
- Required before queue system configuration (11)

## Estimated Effort
16-24 hours (Medium)

## Implementation Notes
- Use Laravel's schema builder for all migrations
- Design for scalability with proper indexing strategy
- Consider data retention and archival requirements
- Plan for future schema evolution with versioning
- Use UUID primary keys for public-facing entities

## Testing Strategy
- Test all migration up and down operations
- Verify foreign key constraints and data integrity
- Performance testing of queries with indexes
- Validate seeder data generation and consistency
- Test database rollback and recovery scenarios
