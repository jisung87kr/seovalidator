# Task 018: Docker Configuration & Containerization

## Overview
Complete Docker containerization setup for development and production environments with optimized configurations for performance, security, and scalability.

## Description
Create comprehensive Docker configuration including multi-stage Dockerfiles, docker-compose setups for different environments, and container orchestration. Implement best practices for security, performance optimization, and development workflow integration. Establish consistent deployment environments across development, staging, and production.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multi-stage Dockerfile optimized for production deployment
- [ ] docker-compose.yml for development environment with hot reloading
- [ ] docker-compose.prod.yml for production deployment
- [ ] Container health checks and monitoring configuration
- [ ] Environment-specific configuration management
- [ ] Database containerization with persistent volume management
- [ ] Redis cache container integration
- [ ] Nginx reverse proxy configuration
- [ ] SSL certificate management for production
- [ ] Container security best practices implementation

## Technical Requirements
- Create optimized Dockerfile with minimal attack surface
- Configure docker-compose for multi-service orchestration
- Set up persistent volumes for database and file storage
- Implement environment variable management for different deployments
- Configure container networking and service discovery
- Set up log aggregation and monitoring for containers
- Implement backup and restore procedures for containerized data
- Create container startup scripts and health checks

## Dependencies
- Task 001: Laravel Application Setup (required for application to containerize)
- Task 003: Database Design & Migration Setup (required for database containerization)

## Estimated Effort
16-24 hours (Medium)

## Implementation Notes
- This task cannot run in parallel as it requires completed application setup
- Focus on creating production-ready containers with security best practices
- Ensure development environment provides good developer experience
- Optimize container build times and image sizes for efficient deployment
- Document container management procedures for operations team

## Testing Strategy
- Container build testing: Verify images build successfully across environments
- Service integration testing: Validate all services communicate properly
- Performance testing: Measure container startup times and resource usage
- Security testing: Scan images for vulnerabilities and misconfigurations
- Deployment testing: Validate deployment procedures on target environments
