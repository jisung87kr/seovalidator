# Task 006: Content & Performance Analyzer Module

## Overview
Implement content analysis capabilities including keyword optimization, readability metrics, and comprehensive performance measurements. This analyzer will evaluate content quality and site performance factors that directly impact SEO rankings and user experience.

## Description
Build a specialized analyzer module that focuses on content optimization and performance metrics. This includes keyword density analysis, readability scoring, content structure evaluation, image optimization checks, Core Web Vitals measurement, and overall site performance assessment.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Content analyzer class implementing the standard analyzer interface
- [ ] Keyword density and distribution analysis
- [ ] Readability scoring using established metrics (Flesch-Kincaid, etc.)
- [ ] Content structure evaluation (headings hierarchy, word count)
- [ ] Image optimization analysis (alt text, file sizes, formats)
- [ ] Core Web Vitals measurement (LCP, FID, CLS)
- [ ] Page load performance metrics and resource analysis
- [ ] Mobile vs desktop performance comparison
- [ ] Comprehensive scoring system with weighted factors
- [ ] Full test coverage including performance metric validation

## Technical Requirements
- Create `ContentPerformanceAnalyzer` class in `app/Services/Analyzers/`
- Implement text analysis algorithms for keyword and readability metrics
- Integrate with Puppeteer for accurate performance measurement
- Add image analysis capabilities for optimization recommendations
- Include Core Web Vitals collection using browser APIs
- Provide comparative analysis between mobile and desktop performance

## Dependencies
- Must be completed after Core Analysis Engine Architecture (004)
- Can be developed in parallel with Technical SEO Analyzer Module (005)
- Conflicts with task 005 due to shared resource dependencies

## Estimated Effort
24-40 hours (Large)

## Implementation Notes
- Use established readability formulas and libraries where possible
- Ensure performance measurements are consistent and reliable
- Consider content language detection for appropriate readability metrics
- Implement efficient text processing for large content volumes
- Focus on metrics that correlate strongly with SEO performance

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for content analysis algorithms
- Performance measurement accuracy validation
- Cross-platform testing for consistent results
- Large content volume testing for performance optimization
- Comparative testing against established SEO tools for metric validation
