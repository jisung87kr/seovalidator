# Task 016: Unit Tests & Feature Test Suite

## Overview
Develop comprehensive test suite covering all analyzers, services, and core functionality with focus on achieving 90%+ code coverage and reliable test-driven development practices.

## Description
Implement a complete testing framework using PHPUnit for unit tests and Laravel's testing capabilities for feature tests. Create comprehensive test coverage for all SEO analyzers, data services, validation logic, and API endpoints. Establish testing conventions and patterns that ensure code quality and prevent regressions.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] PHPUnit test suite with 90%+ code coverage
- [ ] Unit tests for all analyzer classes (Meta, Heading, Performance, etc.)
- [ ] Feature tests for complete user workflows
- [ ] Integration tests for external API connections
- [ ] Test factories and seeders for consistent test data
- [ ] Mocking strategies for external dependencies
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and load testing
- [ ] Test database configuration and cleanup
- [ ] Continuous integration test pipeline integration
- [ ] Test documentation and running instructions

## Technical Requirements
- Configure PHPUnit with Laravel testing environment
- Create test database with proper migration handling
- Implement test factories for all models and data structures
- Mock external services (Google APIs, third-party validators)
- Create base test classes for common testing patterns
- Implement performance testing for analyzer execution times
- Set up code coverage reporting with detailed metrics
- Configure test environment variables and dependencies

## Dependencies
- Task 004: SEO Analyzer Core Logic (required for testing analyzer functionality)
- Task 005: Meta Data Analyzer Implementation (required for meta analyzer tests)
- Task 006: Heading Structure & Content Analyzer (required for heading analyzer tests)

## Estimated Effort
24-40 hours (Large)

## Implementation Notes
- This is a parallel task that can be developed alongside other features
- Focus on creating reliable, maintainable tests that catch real issues
- Establish testing patterns that can be followed for future development
- Ensure tests are fast enough for frequent execution during development
- Create verbose test output for debugging purposes per project guidelines

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: Individual class and method testing with isolated dependencies
- Feature tests: End-to-end workflow testing through HTTP endpoints
- Integration tests: External service integration with proper mocking
- Performance tests: Analyzer execution time and memory usage validation
- Regression tests: Prevent previously fixed bugs from reoccurring
