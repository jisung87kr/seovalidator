# Task 010: Real-time Analysis Progress Updates

## Overview
Implement WebSocket-based real-time progress updates using Laravel Broadcasting to provide users with live feedback during SEO analysis operations.

## Description
Develop a real-time communication system that keeps users informed about the progress of their SEO analysis requests. This involves setting up WebSocket connections through Laravel Broadcasting, implementing progress tracking mechanisms, and creating frontend components that display live updates as analysis tasks are processed in the background queue system.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Laravel Broadcasting configured with WebSocket driver (Pusher or Socket.io)
- [ ] Progress tracking system for SEO analysis jobs
- [ ] WebSocket event broadcasting for progress updates
- [ ] Frontend JavaScript listeners for real-time updates
- [ ] Progress bars and status indicators in the UI
- [ ] Real-time notification system for completed analyses
- [ ] Error handling and fallback for connection failures
- [ ] Queue job progress tracking integration
- [ ] User-specific progress channels for privacy

## Technical Requirements
- Configure Laravel Broadcasting with WebSocket provider
- Create progress tracking events and listeners
- Implement job progress tracking in queue workers
- Build JavaScript WebSocket connection management
- Create real-time UI components for progress display
- Add progress percentage calculations and time estimates
- Implement connection retry logic and fallback mechanisms
- Set up user authentication for WebSocket channels
- Create database tables for progress state persistence

## Dependencies
- Task 003: Queue System & Background Processing
- Task 009: Laravel Blade Dashboard Templates

## Estimated Effort
16-24 hours (Medium)

## Implementation Notes
- Use Laravel's built-in broadcasting system for consistency
- Implement graceful degradation when WebSocket connections fail
- Consider rate limiting to prevent abuse of real-time features
- Ensure progress updates are accurate and meaningful to users
- Test thoroughly with concurrent users and multiple analysis jobs

## Testing Strategy
- Test WebSocket connection establishment and maintenance
- Verify progress updates are received in real-time
- Test connection recovery after network interruptions
- Validate progress accuracy against actual job completion
- Test with multiple concurrent users and analysis jobs
- Verify user isolation and privacy of progress channels
