# Task 20: RESTful API Endpoints & Authentication

## Overview
Build core RESTful API endpoints for URL analysis functionality with secure API key authentication system.

## Description
Develop a comprehensive API layer that exposes the SEO validation functionality through REST endpoints. Implement API key authentication middleware to secure access and ensure proper authorization. The API should provide endpoints for submitting URLs for analysis, retrieving analysis results, and managing analysis jobs with proper JSON responses and error handling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Core API endpoints implemented (/api/v1/analyze, /api/v1/results, /api/v1/status)
- [ ] API key authentication middleware created and configured
- [ ] JSON response format standardized across all endpoints
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization implemented
- [ ] Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- [ ] API versioning structure established
- [ ] Authentication token generation and management system
- [ ] Request/response logging for API calls
- [ ] Basic API endpoint testing implemented

## Technical Requirements
- Create API routes with versioning (/api/v1/)
- Implement middleware for API key validation
- Build controllers for URL analysis operations
- Create API resource classes for consistent JSON responses
- Implement request validation using Form Request classes
- Add API-specific exception handling
- Create API key model and migration
- Implement rate limiting preparation (interface for next task)
- Add API response helpers and utilities

## Dependencies
- Task 9: Database Schema & Models (requires URL and analysis models)
- Task 12: Core SEO Analysis Engine (requires analysis functionality)

## Estimated Effort
24-40 hours (Large)

## Implementation Notes
- Must be completed before API documentation and rate limiting
- Focus on clean RESTful API design principles
- Ensure proper separation between web and API controllers
- Implement middleware that can be extended for rate limiting
- Use Laravel's API resource pattern for consistent responses

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for API controllers and middleware
- Integration tests for complete API workflows
- Authentication testing with valid/invalid API keys
- Input validation testing with edge cases
- Response format validation testing
