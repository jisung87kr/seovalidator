# Task 019: Production Deployment & CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview
Establish complete production deployment infrastructure with automated CI/CD pipeline, monitoring, and operational procedures for reliable and scalable application delivery.

## Description
Implement comprehensive production deployment setup including automated CI/CD pipeline, infrastructure as code, monitoring and alerting systems, and operational procedures. Create reliable deployment processes with rollback capabilities, performance monitoring, and security compliance for production environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Automated CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions or similar
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/CloudFormation) for cloud resources
- [ ] Production deployment automation with zero-downtime deployments
- [ ] Database migration automation with rollback capabilities
- [ ] Application monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana or equivalent
- [ ] Log aggregation and analysis system (ELK stack or similar)
- [ ] Error tracking and alerting system (Sentry or equivalent)
- [ ] Performance monitoring and APM integration
- [ ] Security scanning in deployment pipeline
- [ ] Backup and disaster recovery procedures

## Technical Requirements
- Configure CI/CD pipeline with automated testing, building, and deployment
- Set up production infrastructure with load balancing and auto-scaling
- Implement monitoring stack with metrics collection and visualization
- Configure centralized logging with search and analysis capabilities
- Set up alerting system for system health and performance issues
- Implement security scanning for vulnerabilities and compliance
- Create deployment procedures with rollback and recovery mechanisms
- Configure SSL/TLS certificates and security headers

## Dependencies
- Task 016: Unit Tests & Feature Test Suite (required for automated testing in pipeline)
- Task 017: API Integration Testing (required for deployment validation)
- Task 018: Docker Configuration & Containerization (required for container deployment)

## Estimated Effort
24-40 hours (Large)

## Implementation Notes
- This task must be completed after all testing and containerization work
- Focus on creating reliable, automated deployment processes
- Ensure comprehensive monitoring and alerting for production visibility
- Implement security best practices throughout the deployment pipeline
- Document operational procedures for incident response and maintenance

## Testing Strategy
- Pipeline testing: Validate CI/CD pipeline execution and deployment automation
- Infrastructure testing: Verify infrastructure provisioning and configuration
- Monitoring testing: Validate monitoring, alerting, and dashboard functionality
- Disaster recovery testing: Test backup and restore procedures
- Security testing: Validate security controls and compliance measures
