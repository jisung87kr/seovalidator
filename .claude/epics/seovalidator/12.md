# Task 12: Core Analysis Engine Architecture

## Overview
Build the orchestration service that manages and coordinates all SEO analyzers. This core engine will serve as the central hub for running multiple analysis modules, aggregating results, and providing a unified interface for the analysis workflow.

## Description
Implement the central Analysis Engine that orchestrates multiple SEO analyzer modules. This service will manage the execution flow, handle dependencies between analyzers, aggregate results from different analysis modules, and provide error handling and logging throughout the analysis process.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Analysis service class with orchestration capabilities
- [ ] Analyzer interface defining standard contract for all modules
- [ ] Result aggregation system that combines outputs from multiple analyzers
- [ ] Error handling and logging throughout the analysis workflow
- [ ] Configuration system for enabling/disabling specific analyzers
- [ ] Progress tracking and status reporting for long-running analyses
- [ ] Unit tests covering all core functionality
- [ ] Integration tests with mock analyzer implementations

## Technical Requirements
- Create `AnalysisEngine` service class in `app/Services/`
- Define `AnalyzerInterface` contract in `app/Contracts/`
- Implement result aggregation with standardized output format
- Add configuration management for analyzer modules
- Include comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Provide progress tracking capabilities for real-time updates

## Dependencies
- Must be completed after infrastructure setup (9)
- Must be completed after database schema implementation (11)
- Required before any specific analyzer modules can be implemented

## Estimated Effort
24-40 hours (Large)

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on creating a flexible architecture that can accommodate various analyzer types
- Ensure the engine can handle both synchronous and asynchronous analyzer execution
- Design for easy extension when adding new analyzer modules in the future
- Consider memory and performance implications when processing large sites

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each core component
- Integration tests with multiple mock analyzers
- Error handling verification under various failure scenarios
- Performance testing with simulated analyzer loads
