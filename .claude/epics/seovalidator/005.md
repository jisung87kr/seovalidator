# Task 005: Technical SEO Analyzer Module

## Overview
Implement comprehensive technical SEO checks including meta tags, headers, schema markup, and performance metrics. This analyzer will examine the technical foundation of websites to identify SEO optimization opportunities and issues.

## Description
Build a specialized analyzer module that focuses on technical SEO aspects. This includes validation of meta tags, HTTP headers, structured data (schema.org), URL structure, canonical tags, robots.txt, sitemap analysis, and basic performance metrics that impact SEO rankings.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Technical analyzer class implementing the standard analyzer interface
- [ ] Meta tag analysis (title, description, keywords, Open Graph, Twitter Cards)
- [ ] HTTP header validation (status codes, redirects, caching headers)
- [ ] Schema markup detection and validation
- [ ] URL structure analysis (length, parameters, readability)
- [ ] Canonical tag and duplicate content detection
- [ ] Robots.txt and sitemap accessibility checks
- [ ] Basic performance metrics (page load time, resource sizes)
- [ ] Structured results with severity levels and recommendations
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite covering all analysis functions

## Technical Requirements
- Create `TechnicalSeoAnalyzer` class in `app/Services/Analyzers/`
- Implement DOM parsing for meta tag extraction
- Add HTTP client integration for header analysis
- Include structured data validation using schema.org specifications
- Provide detailed scoring system for each technical aspect
- Generate actionable recommendations for identified issues

## Dependencies
- Must be completed after Core Analysis Engine Architecture (004)
- Can be developed in parallel with Content & Performance Analyzer Module (006)

## Estimated Effort
24-40 hours (Large)

## Implementation Notes
- Use DOMDocument or similar for reliable HTML parsing
- Integrate with external APIs for schema validation when possible
- Consider mobile-specific technical SEO factors
- Ensure the analyzer can handle various HTML structures and edge cases
- Prioritize checks that have the highest SEO impact

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each technical check function
- Integration tests with real website examples
- Edge case testing with malformed HTML and unusual structures
- Performance testing with large pages and complex schemas
- Validation of recommendations accuracy and usefulness
