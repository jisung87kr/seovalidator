- [ ] Heatmaps for page performance visualization
- [ ] Dashboard widgets with key metric summaries
- [ ] Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
- [ ] Export functionality for charts (PNG, PDF, CSV)
- [ ] Interactive tooltips and data point exploration
- [ ] Color-coded severity indicators for SEO issues
