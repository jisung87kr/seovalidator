# Task 11: Queue System & Redis Configuration

## Overview
Configure Redis for caching and queue management to enable asynchronous processing of URL analysis tasks and improve application performance.

## Description
Set up Redis server and configure Laravel's queue system for handling asynchronous URL analysis processing. This includes Redis installation and configuration, Laravel queue configuration, job class creation, and worker process setup to handle background processing efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Redis server installed and configured for both cache and queues
- [ ] Laravel queue configuration updated to use Redis driver
- [ ] Queue worker processes configured and tested
- [ ] Job classes created for URL analysis tasks
- [ ] Failed job handling and retry mechanisms implemented
- [ ] Queue monitoring and health checks established
- [ ] Cache configuration optimized for analysis results
- [ ] Redis security and persistence settings configured
- [ ] Queue dashboard/monitoring tools integrated

## Technical Requirements
- Install and configure Redis server with appropriate memory settings
- Configure Laravel cache and queue drivers to use Redis
- Create job classes for asynchronous URL analysis processing
- Implement job batching for bulk analysis operations
- Set up queue worker supervision (Supervisor or similar)
- Configure job retry logic and failed job handling
- Implement cache strategies for analysis results and API responses
- Add queue monitoring and health check endpoints

## Dependencies
- Must be completed after Laravel application setup (7)
- Independent of database schema setup (9)

## Estimated Effort
8-16 hours (Small)

## Implementation Notes
- Configure Redis with appropriate memory limits and eviction policies
- Set up separate Redis databases for cache and queue operations
- Implement graceful job failure handling with proper logging
- Consider queue priority levels for different analysis types
- Plan for horizontal scaling of queue workers

## Testing Strategy
- Test job dispatch and processing functionality
- Verify Redis connectivity and failover behavior
- Test queue worker restart and recovery scenarios
- Performance testing under high queue loads
- Validate cache invalidation and refresh strategies
